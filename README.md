### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**jakekafrissen/jakekafrissen** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Previous coding experience: I have never coded before, but this summer, I watched tutorials on how to code for colors, backgrounds, and pasting pictures. I will be learning how to code as I go!
Reasons for taking this class: I want to learn about how the technological side of businesses work. Reading how to code for simple math equations in the link provided was fascinating, and I'm excited to see how they work on a larger scale when the code is put into practice.
Other interests: I am also interested in playing soccer, writing, playing the drums, and watching the NFL.
Goals you have and/or projects you'd like to complete: My goal is to blend what I learn in computer science with what I learn in statistics this year by creating functioning spreadsheets through coding for different equations that take all kinds of inputs and outputs.
